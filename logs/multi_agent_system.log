CodeIgniter is based on the Model-View-Controller development pattern. MVC is a software approach that separates application logic from presentation. In practice, it permits your web pages to contain minimal scripting since the presentation is separate from the PHP scripting.

The Model represents your data structures. Typically your model classes will contain functions that help you retrieve, insert, and update information in your database.
The View is the information that is being presented to a user. A View will normally be a web page, but in CodeIgniter, a view can also be a page fragment like a header or footer. It can also be an RSS page, or any other type of “page”.
The Controller serves as an intermediary between the Model, the View, and any other resources needed to process the HTTP request and generate a web page.
CodeIgniter has a fairly loose approach to MVC since Models are not required. If you don’t need the added separation, or find that maintaining models requires more complexity than you want, you can ignore them and build your application minimally using Controllers and Views. CodeIgniter also enables you to incorporate your own existing scripts, or even develop core libraries for the system, enabling you to work in a way that makes the most sense to you.

Electronic Health Record
The purest type of electronic clinical data which is obtained at the point of care at a medical facility, hospital, clinic or practice. Often referred to as the electronic medical record (EMR), the EMR is generally not available to outside researchers. The data collected includes administrative and demographic information, diagnosis, treatment, prescription drugs, laboratory tests, physiologic monitoring data, hospitalization, patient insurance, etc.

Individual organizations such as hospitals or health systems may provide access to internal staff.  Larger collaborations, such as the NIH Collaboratory Distributed Research Network provides mediated or collaborative access to clinical data repositories by eligible researchers.  Additionally, the UW De-identified Clinical Data Repository (DCDR) and the Stanford Center for Clinical Informatics allow for initial cohort identification.

Administrative Data
Often associated with electronic health records, these are primarily hospital discharge data reported to a government agency like AHRQ.

Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (H-CUP)
HCUPnet is a free, on-line query system based on data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). It provides access to health statistics and information on hospital inpatient and emergency department utilization. The project includes a number of datasets and sample studies listed under the information icon.

Claims Data
Claims data describe the billable interactions (insurance claims) between insured patients and the healthcare delivery system. Claims data falls into four general categories: inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and enrollment. The sources of claims data can be obtained from the government (e.g., Medicare) and/or commercial health firms (e.g., United HealthCare).

Basic Stand Alone (BSA) Medicare Claims Public Use Files (PUFs)
This is the Basic Stand Alone (BSA) Public Use Files (PUF) for Medicare claims. This is a claim-level file in which each record is a claim incurred by a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Claims include inpatient/outpatient care, prescription drugs, DME, SNF, hospice, etc. There are some demographic and claim-related variables provided in every PUF.
Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data
Data that summarize utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers.
Medicaid Data Sources
The Medicaid Analytic eXtract data contains state-submitted data on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization and payments. The CMS-64 provides data on Medicaid and SCHIP Budget and Expenditure Systems.
Medicaid Statistical Information System
MSIS is the basic source of state-submitted eligibility and claims data on the Medicaid population, their characteristics, utilization, and payments and is available by clicking on the link on the left-side column.
Patient / Disease Registries
Disease registries are clinical information systems that track a narrow range of key data for certain chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. Registries often provide critical information for managing patient conditions.

Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN)
The Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) is a collaborative project that will provide researchers around the globe with access to a vast repository of Alzheimer’s disease research data and the sophisticated analytical tools and computational power needed to work with that data.
National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR)
The NCDR® is the American College of Cardiology’s worldwide suite of data registries helping hospitals and private practices measure and improve the quality of cardiovascular care they provide. The NCDR encompasses six hospital-based registries and one outpatient registry. There are currently more than 2,400 hospitals and nearly 1,000 outpatient providers participating in NCDR registries.
National Program of Cancer Registries
CDC provides support for states and territories to maintain registries that provide high-quality data. Data collected by local cancer registries enable public health professionals to understand and address the cancer burden more effectively.
National Trauma Data Bank
The National Trauma Data Bank® (NTDB) is the largest aggregation of trauma registry data ever assembled. The goal of the NTDB is to inform the medical community, the public, and decision makers about a wide variety of issues that characterize the current state of care for injured persons.

Electronic Health Record
The purest type of electronic clinical data which is obtained at the point of care at a medical facility, hospital, clinic or practice. Often referred to as the electronic medical record (EMR), the EMR is generally not available to outside researchers. The data collected includes administrative and demographic information, diagnosis, treatment, prescription drugs, laboratory tests, physiologic monitoring data, hospitalization, patient insurance, etc.

Individual organizations such as hospitals or health systems may provide access to internal staff.  Larger collaborations, such as the NIH Collaboratory Distributed Research Network provides mediated or collaborative access to clinical data repositories by eligible researchers.  Additionally, the UW De-identified Clinical Data Repository (DCDR) and the Stanford Center for Clinical Informatics allow for initial cohort identification.

Administrative Data
Often associated with electronic health records, these are primarily hospital discharge data reported to a government agency like AHRQ.

Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (H-CUP)
HCUPnet is a free, on-line query system based on data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). It provides access to health statistics and information on hospital inpatient and emergency department utilization. The project includes a number of datasets and sample studies listed under the information icon.
Datasets are available for purchase.

Claims Data
Claims data describe the billable interactions (insurance claims) between insured patients and the healthcare delivery system. Claims data falls into four general categories: inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and enrollment. The sources of claims data can be obtained from the government (e.g., Medicare) and/or commercial health firms (e.g., United HealthCare).

Basic Stand Alone (BSA) Medicare Claims Public Use Files (PUFs)
This is the Basic Stand Alone (BSA) Public Use Files (PUF) for Medicare claims. This is a claim-level file in which each record is a claim incurred by a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Claims include inpatient/outpatient care, prescription drugs, DME, SNF, hospice, etc. There are some demographic and claim-related variables provided in every PUF.
Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data
Data that summarize utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers.
Medicaid Data Sources
The Medicaid Analytic eXtract data contains state-submitted data on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization and payments. The CMS-64 provides data on Medicaid and SCHIP Budget and Expenditure Systems.
Medicaid Statistical Information System
MSIS is the basic source of state-submitted eligibility and claims data on the Medicaid population, their characteristics, utilization, and payments and is available by clicking on the link on the left-side column.
Patient / Disease Registries
Disease registries are clinical information systems that track a narrow range of key data for certain chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. Registries often provide critical information for managing patient conditions.

Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN)
The Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) is a collaborative project that will provide researchers around the globe with access to a vast repository of Alzheimer’s disease research data and the sophisticated analytical tools and computational power needed to work with that data.
National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR)
The NCDR® is the American College of Cardiology’s worldwide suite of data registries helping hospitals and private practices measure and improve the quality of cardiovascular care they provide. The NCDR encompasses six hospital-based registries and one outpatient registry. There are currently more than 2,400 hospitals and nearly 1,000 outpatient providers participating in NCDR registries.
National Program of Cancer Registries
CDC provides support for states and territories to maintain registries that provide high-quality data. Data collected by local cancer registries enable public health professionals to understand and address the cancer burden more effectively.
National Trauma Data Bank
The National Trauma Data Bank® (NTDB) is the largest aggregation of trauma registry data ever assembled. The goal of the NTDB is to inform the medical community, the public, and decision makers about a wide variety of issues that characterize the current state of care for injured persons.
Surveillance, Prevention, and Management of Diabetes Mellitus DataLink (SUPREME DM)

History

Statuette of Imhotep in the Louvre
Main article: History of medicine
Throughout history, people have written about diseases, how human beings might contract them and what could be done to remedy it. Medicine ranged from folklore and witchcraft to modern evidence-based medicine.[1][2] Among the most notable early medical descriptions are found in texts from Egypt (Edwin Smith Papyrus, Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Gynecological Papyrus),[3] Mesopotamia (Diagnostic Handbook), India (Sushruta Samhita, Charaka Samhita), China (Huangdi Neijing), Rome (De Medicina), and Greece (De Materia Medica). Important medical works in the medieval Islamic era include texts from Persia (The Canon of Medicine of Ibn Sina), Spain (Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi's Kitab al-Tasrif), Iraq (De Gradibus), and Syria (Ibn al-Nafis' Comprehensive Book on Medicine), while important medical texts from early medieval Europe include those from England (Compendium Medicinæ) and Byzantine Greece (Medical Compendium in Seven Books).

Following Vesalius, William Harvey, Ignaz Semmelweis, Louis Pasteur, and others, the medical community have changed the way it conducts research. After incorporating the scientific method, medical literature has introduced peer review, and is currently divided into journals and textbooks.

Medical journal
See also: Public health journal and Nursing journals
These are publications in which the medical community shares information. The common articles are original articles, reviews and case reports.

Original articles describe methods, results, discussion and conclusions and a new research that is conducted by the authors. Although according to the evidence-based medicine consensus the randomized controlled trials are the gold-standard for medical research, currently, they constitute only a minority of conducted research.
Reviews are an overview of one particular topic of clinical interest in order to refresh the readers' memory, to enhance an emergence concept or the summary recent publications that haven't appeared in the textbooks yet. Other type of reviews are the systematic reviews and the meta-analysis in which a specific clinical dilemma is answered by collecting and summarizing all published data regarding this question.
Case reports are descriptions of clinical cases of rare phenomenon or a new clinical method. Case reports may be of value in assessing unusual medical conditions that cannot be studied in clinical trials.[4] Currently, most of the top-ranked medical journals do not publish case reports because of space constraints or a preference for larger, more definitive studies.

When looking for specific information in any journal one can use the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database. Peer reviewed journals are ranked higher thus are a better source for medical information than non-peer reviewed journals.

Medical textbooks
For a more comprehensive list, see List of medical textbooks.
See also: Category:Medical manuals
A medical manual is literature (usually a book) describing diagnosis, treatment, management, and prognosis of various disorders. The first known medical manual is the Edwin Smith papyrus of ancient Egypt.

After consensus has been reached, it is incorporated in textbooks. There are textbooks on every medical specialty and they contain comprehensive discussion on all diseases and their diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. The first textbook to utilize experts to write specific chapters within the book was the Cecil Textbook of Medicine edited by Russell Cecil, MD in 1927. The book was an immediate international success because of the idea that single or double author medical books was outmoded, "since the scope of medical knowledge was far surpassing the capacity of any single individual to encompass". Since that time, this has been the standard. Examples are:

Cecil Textbook of Medicine[5]
Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine[6]
The Oxford Textbook of Medicine[7]
The Principles and Practice of Medicine
The Textbook of Pain
Harrison's Principal of Internal Medicine is widely considered the most read textbook of medicine ever. It was able to eclipse Cecil's by changing the organization. Instead of organizing by disease, Tinsley Harrison organized the book by region and symptom, allowing students to learn the myriad causes of a patient's symptom, without first knowing the specific disease. Harrison's is also credited for a strong commitment to linking basic science to clinical medicine.[8][9]

Harrison's Principal of Internal Medicine is widely considered the most read textbook of medicine ever. It was able to eclipse Cecil's by changing the organization. Instead of organizing by disease, Tinsley Harrison organized the book by region and symptom, allowing students to learn the myriad causes of a patient's symptom, without first knowing the specific disease. Harrison's is also credited for a strong commitment to linking basic science to clinical medicine.[8][9]

History

Statuette of Imhotep in the Louvre
Main article: History of medicine
Throughout history, people have written about diseases, how human beings might contract them and what could be done to remedy it. Medicine ranged from folklore and witchcraft to modern evidence-based medicine.[1][2] Among the most notable early medical descriptions are found in texts from Egypt (Edwin Smith Papyrus, Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Gynecological Papyrus),[3] Mesopotamia (Diagnostic Handbook), India (Sushruta Samhita, Charaka Samhita), China (Huangdi Neijing), Rome (De Medicina), and Greece (De Materia Medica). Important medical works in the medieval Islamic era include texts from Persia (The Canon of Medicine of Ibn Sina), Spain (Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi's Kitab al-Tasrif), Iraq (De Gradibus), and Syria (Ibn al-Nafis' Comprehensive Book on Medicine), while important medical texts from early medieval Europe include those from England (Compendium Medicinæ) and Byzantine Greece (Medical Compendium in Seven Books).

Following Vesalius, William Harvey, Ignaz Semmelweis, Louis Pasteur, and others, the medical community have changed the way it conducts research. After incorporating the scientific method, medical literature has introduced peer review, and is currently divided into journals and textbooks.

Medical journal
See also: Public health journal and Nursing journals
These are publications in which the medical community shares information. The common articles are original articles, reviews and case reports.

Original articles describe methods, results, discussion and conclusions and a new research that is conducted by the authors. Although according to the evidence-based medicine consensus the randomized controlled trials are the gold-standard for medical research, currently, they constitute only a minority of conducted research.
Reviews are an overview of one particular topic of clinical interest in order to refresh the readers' memory, to enhance an emergence concept or the summary recent publications that haven't appeared in the textbooks yet. Other type of reviews are the systematic reviews and the meta-analysis in which a specific clinical dilemma is answered by collecting and summarizing all published data regarding this question.
Case reports are descriptions of clinical cases of rare phenomenon or a new clinical method. Case reports may be of value in assessing unusual medical conditions that cannot be studied in clinical trials.[4] Currently, most of the top-ranked medical journals do not publish case reports because of space constraints or a preference for larger, more definitive studies.

When looking for specific information in any journal one can use the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database. Peer reviewed journals are ranked higher thus are a better source for medical information than non-peer reviewed journals.

Medical textbooks

See also: Category:Medical manuals
A medical manual is literature (usually a book) describing diagnosis, treatment, management, and prognosis of various disorders. The first known medical manual is the Edwin Smith papyrus of ancient Egypt.

After consensus has been reached, it is incorporated in textbooks. There are textbooks on every medical specialty and they contain comprehensive discussion on all diseases and their diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. The first textbook to utilize experts to write specific chapters within the book was the Cecil Textbook of Medicine edited by Russell Cecil, MD in 1927. The book was an immediate international success because of the idea that single or double author medical books was outmoded, "since the scope of medical knowledge was far surpassing the capacity of any single individual to encompass". Since that time, this has been the standard. Examples are:

2025-01-21T18:12:40.334535+0530INFO[WriteArticleTool] Received Response:ChatCompletionMessage(content='**Title: Advancements in Nanotechnology for Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy**\n\n**Abstract**\n\nCancer remains one of the most formidable health challenges of the 21st century, necessitating innovative approaches to treatment. Traditional cancer therapies, while effective, often suffer from significant limitations, including systemic toxicity and non-specific targeting. Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising solution, offering the potential for highly targeted drug delivery systems that can improve therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. This article explores recent advancements in nanotechnology for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy, highlighting key innovations, challenges, and future directions.\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nCancer therapy has historically relied on surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. While these treatments have proven effective, they are often accompanied by adverse side effects due to indiscriminate action on healthy cells. In recent years, the integration of nanotechnology into drug delivery systems has presented an opportunity to overcome these limitations. By leveraging the unique properties of nanoparticles, researchers aim to enhance the precision of drug delivery to cancer cells, thereby reducing toxicity and improving patient outcomes.\n\n**2. Nanoparticle Design and Functionality**\n\nNanoparticles can be engineered from a variety of materials, including lipids, polymers, metals, and ceramics. Each material offers distinct advantages, such as biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, and controlled release properties. Recent advancements have focused on optimizing nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry to improve tumor targeting and drug release profiles.\n\n**3. Mechanisms of Targeted Drug Delivery**\n\nTargeted drug delivery through nanotechnology exploits various mechanisms to achieve specificity:\n\n- **Passive Targeting:** Utilizes the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, where nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues due to leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage.\n  \n- **Active Targeting:** Involves functionalizing nanoparticles with ligands or antibodies that bind specifically to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, enhancing selectivity.\n\n- **Stimuli-Responsive Systems:** Nanoparticles designed to release drugs in response to specific stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, or enzymes) present in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n**4. Recent Innovations**\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated significant progress in the development of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems:\n\n- **Polymeric Nanoparticles:** Utilize biodegradable polymers to encapsulate chemotherapeutic agents, offering controlled release and enhanced stability.\n\n- **Lipid-Based Nanocarriers:** Liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles have been engineered for improved delivery of hydrophobic drugs, with modifications to enhance circulation time and targeting.\n\n- **Metallic Nanoparticles:** Gold and iron oxide nanoparticles have been investigated for their unique optical and magnetic properties, enabling applications in both therapy and diagnosis (theranostics).\n\n- **Hybrid Nanoparticles:** Combine multiple materials to leverage the advantages of each, such as improved targeting and dual drug loading capabilities.\n\n**5. Challenges and Considerations**\n\nDespite the promising potential of nanotechnology in cancer therapy, several challenges remain:\n\n- **Toxicity and Biocompatibility:** Ensuring that nanoparticles are safe and do not induce adverse immune responses is critical.\n\n- **Manufacturing and Scalability:** Producing nanoparticles with consistent quality and at a scale suitable for clinical use presents technical and regulatory hurdles.\n\n- **Regulatory Approval:** Navigating the complex regulatory landscape for novel nanomedicines requires thorough preclinical and clinical evaluations.\n\n**6. Future Directions**\n\nFuture research in nanotechnology for targeted drug delivery should focus on:\n\n- **Personalized Medicine:** Developing nanoparticles tailored to individual patients’ tumor profiles for more precise treatment.\n\n- **Combination Therapies:** Exploring the synergistic potential of combining nanotechnology with other modalities, such as immunotherapy or gene therapy.\n\n- **Advanced Imaging and Monitoring:** Integrating diagnostic capabilities with therapeutic nanoparticles to enable real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nNanotechnology holds immense promise for revolutionizing cancer therapy through targeted drug delivery. Continued advancements in nanoparticle engineering, coupled with a deeper understanding of tumor biology, will pave the way for more effective and safer cancer treatments. As research progresses, interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to overcome existing challenges and fully realize the potential of nanotechnology in oncology.\n\n**References**\n\nA comprehensive list of references would be included here to support the research, detailing primary literature, reviews, and key studies in the field of nanotechnology and cancer therapy.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Traditional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, often suffer from significant drawbacks, including systemic toxicity, non-specific targeting, and the development of drug resistance. In recent years, nanotechnology has emerged as a promising frontier in cancer therapy, offering innovative solutions for targeted drug delivery. By exploiting the unique properties of nanoparticles, such as their size, surface characteristics, and ability to be functionalized, researchers aim to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs while minimizing side effects. This article explores the recent advancements in nanotechnology for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy, highlighting the potential of these technologies to revolutionize cancer treatment.\n\n**Literature Review**\n\nThe application of nanotechnology in medicine, particularly in cancer therapy, has been extensively studied over the past few decades. Nanoparticles, which range in size from 1 to 100 nanometers, can be engineered to improve drug solubility, enhance bioavailability, and provide controlled release. These properties make them ideal candidates for drug delivery systems aimed at improving therapeutic outcomes in oncology.\n\n**1. Types of Nanoparticles in Cancer Therapy**\n\nVarious types of nanoparticles have been developed for cancer therapy, including liposomes, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles such as gold and silica. Liposomes, as the first successfully utilized nanocarriers, encapsulate drugs in a phospholipid bilayer, allowing for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug loading. Dendrimers, with their branched, tree-like structures, facilitate multivalent drug attachment and have shown promise in targeting specific cancer cells. Polymeric nanoparticles, which can be engineered from biodegradable materials like PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)), offer controlled drug release and improved circulation times. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold and silica, are explored for their unique optical properties and ease of surface modification.\n\n**2. Targeting Mechanisms**\n\nNanoparticles can be designed to target cancer cells through passive or active mechanisms. Passive targeting exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, where nanoparticles accumulate in the tumor microenvironment due to leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage. Active targeting involves functionalizing nanoparticles with ligands, such as antibodies or peptides, that bind specifically to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells. This approach enhances the specificity and uptake of nanoparticles by malignant cells, reducing off-target effects and improving therapeutic indices.\n\n**3. Stimuli-Responsive Nanoparticles**\n\nRecent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles that release their payload in response to specific internal or external triggers. These triggers can include pH changes, temperature variations, enzyme presence, or external stimuli such as light, ultrasound, or magnetic fields. For instance, pH-sensitive nanoparticles exploit the acidic environment of tumors to deliver drugs specifically at the cancer site, minimizing systemic exposure and reducing side effects. Similarly, temperature-sensitive nanoparticles can release drugs in response to hyperthermia, a common treatment adjunct in oncology.\n\n**4. Clinical Applications and Challenges**\n\nSeveral nanoparticle-based formulations have entered clinical trials, with some already approved for clinical use. For example, Doxil, a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, has demonstrated reduced cardiotoxicity compared to its conventional counterpart. Despite these successes, challenges remain, such as the complexity of large-scale manufacturing, potential toxicity of non-biodegradable materials, and the need for comprehensive understanding of nanoparticle interactions with biological systems.\n\nIn conclusion, nanotechnology presents a transformative approach to cancer therapy, offering the potential for precise, targeted drug delivery systems. Continued research and development are essential to overcome existing challenges and to fully realize the benefits of nanotechnology in oncology. The integration of interdisciplinary efforts will be crucial for the translation of these promising technologies from the laboratory to clinical practice, ultimately improving outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

History

Statuette of Imhotep in the Louvre
Main article: History of medicine
Throughout history, people have written about diseases, how human beings might contract them and what could be done to remedy it. Medicine ranged from folklore and witchcraft to modern evidence-based medicine.[1][2] Among the most notable early medical descriptions are found in texts from Egypt (Edwin Smith Papyrus, Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Gynecological Papyrus),[3] Mesopotamia (Diagnostic Handbook), India (Sushruta Samhita, Charaka Samhita), China (Huangdi Neijing), Rome (De Medicina), and Greece (De Materia Medica). Important medical works in the medieval Islamic era include texts from Persia (The Canon of Medicine of Ibn Sina), Spain (Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi's Kitab al-Tasrif), Iraq (De Gradibus), and Syria (Ibn al-Nafis' Comprehensive Book on Medicine), while important medical texts from early medieval Europe include those from England (Compendium Medicinæ) and Byzantine Greece (Medical Compendium in Seven Books).

Following Vesalius, William Harvey, Ignaz Semmelweis, Louis Pasteur, and others, the medical community have changed the way it conducts research. After incorporating the scientific method, medical literature has introduced peer review, and is currently divided into journals and textbooks.

What is a fracture?
A fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures are usually caused by injuries. Since they can sometimes be serious, it's important to get medical care right away if you think you have a fracture.

What are the different types of fractures?
There are different ways to describe fractures. For example, there are different types of fractures based on:

Whether the bone is partially or completely broken.
Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture.
The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern.
The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse.
Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures.
What causes fractures?
Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls, or sports injuries. Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures.

Low bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone.

What are the symptoms of a fracture?
The symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include:

Intense pain
Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place
Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury
Trouble moving the injured part
If you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away.

How are fractures diagnosed?
To find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken.

What are the treatments for fractures?
The most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals. How long you need to wear it will depend on the type of fracture and which bone is affected. But it's often for several weeks. Your provider will let you know when you can get it off.

In some cases, you may need surgery to put in plates, pins, or screws to keep the bone in place.

What is a fracture?
A fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures are usually caused by injuries. Since they can sometimes be serious, it's important to get medical care right away if you think you have a fracture.

What are the different types of fractures?
There are different ways to describe fractures. For example, there are different types of fractures based on:

Whether the bone is partially or completely broken.
Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture.
The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern.
The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse.
Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures.
What causes fractures?
Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls, or sports injuries. Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures.

Low bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone.

What are the symptoms of a fracture?
The symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include:

Intense pain
Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place
Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury
Trouble moving the injured part
If you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away.

How are fractures diagnosed?
To find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken.

What are the treatments for fractures?
The most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals. How long you need to wear it will depend on the type of fracture and which bone is affected. But it's often for several weeks. Your provider will let you know when you can get it off.

In some cases, you may need surgery to put in plates, pins, or screws to keep the bone in place.

Traditional cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, often face significant limitations such as non-specificity, severe side effects, and drug resistance. As a result, there is an urgent need for more effective and targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanotechnology, the manipulation and application of materials at the nanometer scale, has emerged as a promising avenue for revolutionizing cancer treatment, particularly in the realm of targeted drug delivery. This approach aims to enhance the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs by improving their delivery to tumor sites while minimizing systemic toxicity.\n\n**Literature Review**\n\nRecent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems designed specifically for cancer therapy. The key advantage of these systems lies in their ability to encapsulate therapeutic agents and deliver them directly to cancerous tissues, thus enhancing drug accumulation at the tumor site and reducing off-target effects.\n\n1. **Nanocarriers and Their Types**: Various types of nanocarriers have been developed, each with unique properties that can be tailored for specific therapeutic needs. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and micelles are among the most extensively studied nanocarriers in cancer therapy. Liposomes, for instance, are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, providing a versatile platform for drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles offer precise control over drug release profiles and can be engineered to respond to environmental stimuli such as pH or temperature changes.\n\n2. **Targeting Strategies**: Targeted drug delivery is achieved through active or passive targeting mechanisms. Passive targeting exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon where nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissue due to leaky vasculature. Active targeting involves functionalizing the surface of nanocarriers with ligands or antibodies that bind specifically to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells. This approach significantly enhances the specificity and uptake of nanocarriers, reducing collateral damage to healthy tissues.\n\n3. **Advancements in Smart Nanocarriers**: The development of smart nanocarriers that respond to internal or external stimuli represents a significant leap forward in targeted drug delivery. These nanocarriers can be engineered to release their therapeutic payload in response to specific triggers such as pH variations, enzymatic activity, or external fields (e.g., magnetic or light). Such responsiveness allows for controlled and site-specific drug release, improving the therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects.\n\n4. **Clinical Applications and Challenges**: Several nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have entered clinical trials, demonstrating promising results in terms of safety and efficacy. For instance, the FDA-approved liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, known as Doxil, has shown improved pharmacokinetics and reduced cardiotoxicity compared to conventional doxorubicin. However, challenges remain, including the need for scalable manufacturing processes, long-term toxicity evaluations, and overcoming biological barriers such as the mononuclear phagocyte system that can clear nanoparticles from circulation.\n\n5. **Future Directions**: The future of nanotechnology in cancer therapy lies in the development of multifunctional nanocarriers that combine diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, known as theranostics. These systems enable real-time monitoring of drug delivery and treatment response, paving the way for personalized cancer therapy. Additionally, advances in nanotechnology are expected to facilitate the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize nanoparticle design and enhance treatment outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, nanotechnology holds tremendous potential for transforming cancer therapy through innovative drug delivery strategies. While significant progress has been made, ongoing research is essential to address current limitations and fully realize the benefits of nanotechnology in clinical settings. The continued collaboration between multidisciplinary fields will be crucial in advancing this promising frontier in cancer treatment.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

What is a fracture?
A fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures are usually caused by injuries. Since they can sometimes be serious, it's important to get medical care right away if you think you have a fracture.

What are the different types of fractures?
There are different ways to describe fractures. For example, there are different types of fractures based on:

Whether the bone is partially or completely broken.
Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture.
The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern.
The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse.
Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures.
What causes fractures?
Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls, or sports injuries. Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures.

Low bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone.

What are the symptoms of a fracture?
The symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include:

Intense pain
Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place
Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury
Trouble moving the injured part
If you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away.

How are fractures diagnosed?
To find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken.

What are the treatments for fractures?
The most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals. How long you need to wear it will depend on the type of fracture and which bone is affected. But it's often for several weeks. Your provider will let you know when you can get it off.

In some cases, you may need surgery to put in plates, pins, or screws to keep the bone in place.
